# PomodoroTimer
A Pomodoro Timer made in Python.
Used TKinter and other libraries to make a GUI based pomodoro timer program.
Uses the "grid" technique to arrange labels and other UI elements.
After every 25 minutes, the user is given a 5 minute break which is shown by the "Timer" label on the top of the screen.
Every 4 succesful work sessions, the user is given a 20 minute break instead of a 5 minute break.
After an entire work session is completed, the user is informed of it by a "☑️" mark on the bottom of the screen.
